# üçé NutriChat: Your Smart AI Food Guide

An intelligent chatbot that provides personalized dietary advice for various health conditions, powered by a fine-tuned language model. This project was developed for the *Confluentia Hackathon*.



## ## About The Project

Navigating dietary restrictions for health conditions like Diabetes or Hypertension can be confusing. NutriChat aims to solve this by providing a simple, form-based interface where users can select their health condition and ask about specific foods to receive instant, personalized, and easy-to-understand nutritional advice.

The chatbot leverages a knowledge base of over 100 food-condition combinations and uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate helpful, human-like explanations.

2.  *Keyword Matching:* The app identifies the food name from the user's input.
3.  *Knowledge Retrieval:* It looks up the identified food and the selected condition in its factual database (foods.csv) to get a base recommendation (e.g., "Good", "Avoid") and a key reason.
4.  *Prompt Engineering:* The retrieved information is constructed into a detailed prompt for the AI model.
5.  *Response Generation:* The fine-tuned GPT-2 model receives the prompt and generates a new, conversational, and detailed explanation.
6.  *Display:* The final advice is displayed to the user in the Streamlit interface.
